# Clickn' Circles

I made this game using python + pygame, and then remade it in unity.

The aim of the game is to click the circles that aren't red to gain as many points as you can in the time given, there is also game modes where you can set the amount of lives you have.

## Installation

PC: (Version 2.0)
